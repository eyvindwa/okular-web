# Reviews for Okular's releases

## Regenerate

TBA

## Sexforce


> For those who love interesting death metal it is an absolute recommendation.
Immaculately produced, it has little to no trouble nestling itself in between the
biggest names of brutal death metal. They make technically challenging and brutal death
metal but at the same time they somehow managed to become more accessible.

\- Lords of metal 83/100


> Another impressing effort from one of the most exciting bands Norway has to offer. Sounds refreshingly different to more or less anything out there
But at the same time the material is sufficiently accessible to appeal to most fans of technical extreme metal.

\- Arctic Metal 9/10 (https://www.arcticmetal.no/album/okular-sexforce)


> A mightily impressive effort from Okular. Fans of acts like Obscura, Opeth and Meshuggah can’t go wrong here. An extremely powerful
Production and technically outstanding musicianship to top it all off.

\- Sea of Tranquillity (https://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&amp;id=14162)

> Okular are required listening for those who enjoy progressive
death with dynamic songwriting ethics at hand.
Accessible in certain songs and then very complex in others, but therein lies the appeal to Okular.

\- The Metal Pit 8.5/10

> An incredibly intelligent and at the same time eluding piece of work. Would’ve been an immediate classic had the music industry been an
environment basing success on sheer musical quality.
